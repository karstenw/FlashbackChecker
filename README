Note: This Fork is a back port of https://github.com/jils/FlashbackChecker to OSX 10.4 Universal Binary.

The NIB file has been recreated as the screenshot and interface file suggested. The code has minimal changes to accomodate 10.4 and some cosmetic changes (warnings surrounded by newlines; some pragma unused to silence warnings)

If you have OSX 10.5 or higher, use the original:

https://github.com/jils/FlashbackChecker

it does _not_ remove it!
